# Unreal Quest 3 Scene Sample

Welcome to the Unreal Quest 3 Scene Sample project! This repository provides a complete example of how to create a passthrough experience in Unreal Engine for the Oculus Quest 3 and introduces a unique shader that acts as a real-time occluder, enabling real-life objects to be seamlessly integrated into the virtual environment.

## Features

- **Passthrough Experience**: Enjoy a seamless passthrough experience on your Oculus Quest 3. Immerse yourself in a combination of the virtual and real worlds, enhancing your XR experiences.

- **Real-Time Occlusion**: The project includes a custom shader that effectively occludes real-life objects in the scene. This allows for interactions and integration of real-world objects with virtual content, creating a more immersive mixed reality environment.
