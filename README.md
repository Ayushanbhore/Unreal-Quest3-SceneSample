# Unreal Quest 3 Scene Sample

Welcome to the Unreal Quest 3 Scene Sample project! This repository provides a complete example of how to create a passthrough experience in Unreal Engine for the Oculus Quest 3 and introduces a unique shader that acts as a real-time occluder, enabling real-life objects to be seamlessly integrated into the virtual environment.

## Features

- **Passthrough Experience**: Enjoy a seamless passthrough experience on your Oculus Quest 3. Immerse yourself in a combination of the virtual and real worlds, enhancing your XR experiences.

- **Real-Time Occlusion**: The project includes a custom shader that effectively occludes real-life objects in the scene. This allows for interactions and integration of real-world objects with virtual content, creating a more immersive mixed reality environment.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:


``` bash
git clone https://github.com/Ayushanbhore/Unreal-Quest3-SceneSample.git
```

2. **Install Unreal Engine**:
Make sure you have Unreal Engine installed. If not, you can download it from [Unreal Engine](https://www.unrealengine.com/).

3. **Open the Project in Unreal Engine**:
Open Unreal Engine and load the project file located in the cloned repository.

4. **Configure Oculus Quest 3**:
Ensure that your Oculus Quest 3 is connected to your development environment, and that you've configured it for use with the Unreal Engine.

5. **Build and Run**:
Build the project and run it on your Oculus Quest 3. You should now be able to experience the passthrough and real-time occlusion features.

6. **Customize and Extend**:
Feel free to customize and extend the project to suit your specific needs. Modify the shader, add new virtual objects, or experiment with other Unreal Engine features.
